{insight_block}

Requirements:

- Propose specific future research directions based on the gaps
- Explicitly mention evidence-scarce sections and avoid overstating conclusions for them
- Integrate conflict_notes attribution and write one dedicated paragraph labeled "观点交锋与实验条件差异 (Debate & Divergence):"
- In that dedicated paragraph, compare experimental-condition variables (e.g., sampling depth, sequencing platform/instrument, time span, sample size, cohort/region, statistical pipeline) and explain plausible causes of divergence
- Be constructive and forward-looking
- Output section body ONLY (no markdown heading, no duplicated title line)
