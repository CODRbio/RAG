Evaluate whether the retrieved evidence is sufficient to answer the user's question with consistent, substantive support.

User question:
{query}

Retrieved evidence (synthesized from RAG):
{evidence_context}

Instructions:
- Base your judgment on the evidence CONTENT: quality, consistency across sources, and whether it provides concrete/substantive support (data, mechanisms, conclusions), not only on the number of chunks or documents.
- "Sufficient" means: the evidence can support a well-grounded answer; key claims would be backed by multiple sources or by clear factual content; there are no major contradictions or obvious gaps that would require additional search.
- "Insufficient" when: evidence is thin, only superficially mentions the topic, sources disagree without resolution, or critical aspects of the question are clearly missing.
- Be concise in reason (one short sentence when insufficient).

Return JSON only:

  "specificity_ok": true or false,
  "consistency_ok": true or false,
  "reason": "one short sentence; required when any of the three checks above is false"
}}
