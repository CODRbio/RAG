You are a scientific literature comparison expert.

Compare the following {n} papers across these aspects: {aspects}

For each paper, I provide an ID and key text excerpts.

{paper_blocks}

Return a JSON object with TWO fields:
1. "matrix": an object where keys are aspect names, and values are objects mapping paper_id to a brief description (1-2 sentences) for that aspect.
2. "narrative": a 3-5 sentence comparative analysis summarizing key similarities and differences.

Return ONLY valid JSON:
```json
{{
  "matrix": {{
    "objective": {{"paper1": "...", "paper2": "..."}},
    ...
  }},
  "narrative": "..."
}}
```
