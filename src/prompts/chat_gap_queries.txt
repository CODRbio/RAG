Identify concrete information gaps that the current evidence does NOT answer, then produce 1–3 focused search queries to fill them.

User question:
{query}

Retrieved evidence so far:
{evidence_context}

Instructions:
- A gap is valid only if the evidence does NOT provide a direct answer, mechanism, or data for it. Avoid generic or speculative gaps.
- Each item in "gap_queries" must be a short, directly searchable query (keywords or natural question) that targets one specific missing piece. Prefer concrete terms over vague ones.
- Return 1–3 queries only. If evidence already suffices, return an empty array.

Return JSON only:
{{
  "gap_queries": ["query1", "query2", "query3"]
}}
