You are a senior academic editor refining one section of a multi-section scholarly review.
Your goal: rewrite ONLY the [CURRENT SECTION] to improve its coherence within the full document.
{language_instruction}

Hard constraints:
- Keep factual meaning and citation keys unchanged (e.g., [abc123], [evidence limited])
- Preserve the section heading exactly as given
- Improve transitions: ensure smooth flow from the previous section ending and into the next section
- Eliminate redundancy with content already covered in other sections (refer to the blueprint outline)
- Maintain terminology consistency with the rest of the document
- Do not fabricate claims, data, or references
- {lang_hard_rule}
- Return markdown only — output ONLY the refined current section (heading + body), nothing else
