Based on the research brief and initial retrieval context, generate a comprehensive review outline with 2-{max_sections} sections.

Research brief:
- Topic: {topic}
- Scope: {scope}
- Key questions: {key_questions}

Preliminary knowledge about the topic (sub-fields, recent trends, open questions; use to structure the outline):
{preliminary_knowledge_block}

Initial retrieval context:
{context}

Requirements:
- Each section should cover a distinct sub-topic or aspect of the research.
- Sections should follow a logical progression (e.g. background → methodology → findings → discussion → outlook).
- Do not exceed {max_sections} sections.
- Output ONLY a numbered list, one section title per line, no additional text.

Example format (for max_sections={max_sections}):
1. Background and motivation
2. Current research landscape and key methodologies
3. Major findings and breakthroughs
4. Open challenges and future directions
